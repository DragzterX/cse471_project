The "Restaurant Management" project is a comprehensive
application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express,
React, Node.js) stack. This project aims to streamline the
operations of a restaurant by offering features such as table
management, account handling, Product Order, and admin panel.
With a user-friendly interface built using React, the project
provides an intuitive experience for both restaurants and
customers. The integration of MongoDB ensures a robust and
scalable database solution, while Node.js and Express facilitate
efficient server-side operations, making the "Restaurant
Management" project a powerful tool for modern restaurant
management.
